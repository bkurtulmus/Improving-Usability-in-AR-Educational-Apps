# Improving Usability in AR Educational Apps

This repository contains the heuristic evaluation, redesign proposals, and supporting documents for a project conducted as part of the **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** course at Sabanci University. The project focused on evaluating the usability of the **EON-XR** augmented reality (AR) educational application and proposing redesigns to enhance its user experience.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project was to identify usability issues in the EON-XR application using Nielsen's Usability Heuristics and propose solutions to improve the overall user experience. The application is designed to facilitate interactive learning by presenting educational content in a three-dimensional, augmented reality format.

### Key Components

- **Heuristic Evaluation Report**: A detailed analysis of the usability issues identified within the EON-XR application, including problems related to system visibility, user control, consistency, and more.
- **Redesign Proposals**: Suggested improvements to the application's user interface (UI), focusing on enhancing navigation, iconography, color coding, and playback controls.
- **Supporting Documentation**: Screenshots and examples of the usability issues, along with mockups of the proposed redesigns.

## Getting Started
